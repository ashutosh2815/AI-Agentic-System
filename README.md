# 🤖 Deep Research Agentic AI

A LangGraph-powered **Agentic AI System** designed to perform deep research and generate high-quality, human-like answers. This project simulates a collaborative workflow between a **Research Agent** and a **Writer Agent**, using stateful, autonomous agents to process user queries from scratch to polished answers.
